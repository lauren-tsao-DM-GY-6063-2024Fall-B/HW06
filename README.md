### What dataset did you use? If not from our class site, include a link.
- I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalpnaik/mushroom-classification-edible-or-poisonous)

### Why did you choose this dataset?
- There's alot of attributes that can be visualized in different ways. For example, I associate stem heights with strokes and cap diameter with ellipses, there are color variations in there that I can play around with as well

### Which fields/features/parameters of the dataset did you use?
- I used the cap-color, stem-height, stem-width, and cap-diameter, does-bruise-or-bleed features

### How many data points did you use?
- Due to the overwhelming number of mushrooms in the original .csv file (61069 varieties!), I reduced the list down to 1500 data points to better see the details in the data as I worked on it

### What are you visualizing? How do the shapes, colors or movement relate to the data values?
- cap-diameter: Differing sizes of the solid-colored arcs in the middle
- cap-color: represented by the different solid colors of the arcs, I made the inner most color a bright pink to draw the eye towards it
- stem-height: used strokes to convey this feature, surrounding the cap-diameter and cap-color arcs, the length of the strokes represents the height of the stems
- stem-width: Represented by the thickness of the stem-height strokes this feature
- does-bruise-or-bleed fields: Indicated by the purple (bruise) and red (red) colors of the stem strokes

### Include drawings and images of reference visualizations
