### What dataset did you use? If not from our class site, include a link.
- I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalpnaik/mushroom-classification-edible-or-poisonous)

### Why did you choose this dataset?
- I really like mushrooms and would like to my hand in drawing them in p5js based on their attributes!

### Which fields/features/parameters of the dataset did you use?
- I used the cap-color, stem-height, stem-width, and cap-diameter fields

### How many data points did you use?
- Due to the overwhelming number of mushrooms in the original .csv file, I reduced the list down to 100 data points

### What are you visualizing? How do the shapes, colors or movement relate to the data values?
- I went for a more literal approach for this homework.
- The size of the caps of the mushrooms represent are dependant on "cap-diameter", and their colors are dependant on the "cap-color"
- For the stems, their differing heights is determined by the "stem-height", and their thickness is by the "stem-width"

### Include drawings and images of reference visualizations
